# Quantum Chess Engine 

This is the *beginning of* a full-stack, hybrid classical-quantum chess engine integrated with a GUI-based frontend built using `pygame`. This project explores the use of Grover's algorithm for quantum-accelerated move selection in chess.


## Features
- Full GUI-based chess interface (pygame)
- Play against a quantum-powered chess engine
- Quantum Grover search selects strong moves dynamically
- Classical logic and evaluation integrated with quantum backend
- Modular architecture, designed for research and industry applications

## Getting Started
